# TSI AI Group Project

A collaborative AI project developed by TSI Master's students, focusing on designing and implementing an AI-based solution to a real-world problem. In groups of three, students design and implement an AI-based solution to tackle a real-world problem. The project involves applying AI techniques like machine learning and data analysis in a functional model, comprehensive report, and final presentation. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for our group project.
