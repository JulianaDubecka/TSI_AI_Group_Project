# UWE AI Group Project
A collaborative AI project developed by UWE Master's students, focusing on designing and implementing an AI-based solution to a real-world problem.
In groups of three, students design and implement an AI-based solution to tackle a real-world problem. The project involves applying AI techniques like machine learning, data analysis in a functional model, comprehensive report, and final presentation. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for our group project.
